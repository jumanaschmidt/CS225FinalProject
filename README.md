## Overview
In this project, we intend to find the shortest and most energy efficient path from one point to a specified destination. There are countless reasons as to why this project is not only useful but also extremely practical. Our program will virtually be able to take a black and white image of almost any land-based terrain, a destination, and a starting point, and be able to find the path of shortest distance and least resistance. This program is applicable for hikers, rescuers, GPS, real estate developers, and more. To be able to demonstrate the full ability of our project, we’ll be using a picture of a mountainous terrain as our input, as there is more variation in height. Additionally, we’ll be referring to the person/thing trying to find the best path as the hiker, in our code and our project’s description, but in reality, anyone with any purpose could find use for this program.
