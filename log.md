# Week 1 (3/28):

### Goals of the week and were they accomplished?
The main goal was to get the project proposal fixed. This took us back to the drawing board on our chat discussing different options to implement the missing graphing algorithms. Meeting with our TA coordinator helped a lot and got us thinking again. We were almost at the point of giving up the height map idea. The goal of rewriting the project proposal was achieved, albeit it was turned in a bit late. 

### Tasks of each member
Each member was in charge of their previous part in the original project proposal. Graphing was handled by David and assisted by Jumana and William. Jumana worked on parts 1 and 4. Successfully rewriting the proposal to fit our new vision for a hiker energy algorithm. Roy will be working on double-checking any time complexity related portions and reviewing the whole paper. William worked on spearheading the idea for the energy tracker being calculated through pixel luminance and focused on that part specifically in the project proposal.

### Obstacles to Goals
Originally we were meant to be researching and gathering more information on specific websites that could help with the original proposal but that got suddenly changed to correcting the proposal. 

### Goals for the following week
For the week of April 4th, we plan to take a deeper look at processing a greyscale image into a heightmap with the PNG class. 
Members have yet to volunteer for this task Work on researching OpenGL to see if it a viable option for graphing output (David will be working on this).

# Week 2 (4/4):

### Goals of the week and were they accomplished?
For this week, the goal was to research the algorithms required for our project and grasp a better understanding of how they work. In addition, we were supposed to plan out a pseudocode on how to implement these algorithms within our code.

### Tasks of each member
Individually, we are to research the algorithms and then discuss our understanding of them as we plan out a pseudocode for our project.

### Obstacles to Goals
However, due to everyone’s busy course load and David getting COVID this week, we were unable to write up a pseudocode as originally planned. So during our free time, we individually researched the algorithms we will be using in our project.

### Goals for the following week
For next week, our goal is to have our pseudocode done and begin our project by implementing the first algorithm.

# Week 3 (4/11):

### Goals of the week and were they accomplished?
Unfortunately, not much progress has been made for the main code file of our project but catching up from EOH left us unable to properly write our research down. The main goal of the week is to set up the header files of possible functions we’ll be using and plan out the flow of the code.

### Tasks of each member
Individually, we are to research the algorithms and then discuss our understanding of them as we plan out pseudocode for our project. Gathering up resources for Dijkstra's Algorithm.

### Obstacles to Goals
Time management with mazes took up a lot of time and left us catching up with other classes. 

### Goals for the following week
Next, we have a big meetup to code on Friday after a heavy exam week. The goals are to get the first algorithm for input images working.

# Week 4 (4/18):

### Goals of the week and were they accomplished?
Worked on Dijkstras algorithm and struggled to convert a PNG into a viable graph.

### Tasks of each member
Jumana and David worked on getting some of the class information within the dijkstras class. Roy and Will tried to figure out on how to convert a PNG into a graph.

### Obstacles to Goals
Got stuck with understanding what variables each map and pair was going to use.

### Goals for the following week
Figure out if the project is viable because we are starting to explode with ideas. Some members are suggesting switching to a simpler plane project that was suggested at the beginning.

# Week 5 (4/25):

### Goals of the week and were they accomplished?
The goal for that week is to start the presentation and final report. As well as debug and fix up drijstikas algorithm. The presentation and report were completed up until needed final project materials. Meaning that they are ready for testing, and analysis slides. The graph class and edge cases were taken care of. This allowed for work on drijstikas algortihmn which was set up. No test cases were made yet.


### Tasks of each member
David and Will worked on the slides while also looking for sources for A* algorithm. Jumana and Roy focused on finishing up drijstikas algorihmn


### Obstacles to Goals
We all sorta started working on different versions of the graph class/drijstikas algorithm in hopes one of them will stick. This slowed down our progress since we didn’t really have a concrete way of telling which method was better until a TA from the office would show up every hour. We also feel that we reached a roadblock that we still do not know how to overcome.


### Goals for the following week
Finish the MP early so that we can work on the final project. Find a way to make test cases for drijstikas algorithm.
