# Week 1 (3/28):

### Goals of the week and were they accomplished?

The main goal was to get the project proposal fixed. This took us back to the drawing board on our chat discussing different options to implement the missing graphing algorithms. Meeting with our TA coordinator helped a lot and got us thinking again. We were almost at the point of giving up the height map idea. The goal of rewriting the project proposal was achieved, albeit it was turned in a bit late. 

### Tasks of each member

Each member was in charge of their previous part in the original project proposal. Graphing was handled by David and assisted by Jumana and William. Jumana worked on parts 1 and 4. Successfully rewriting the proposal to fit our new vision for a hiker energy algorithm. Roy will be working on double-checking any time complexity related portions and reviewing the whole paper. William worked on spearheading the idea for the energy tracker being calculated through pixel luminance and focused on that part specifically in the project proposal

### Obstacles to Goals

Originally we were meant to be researching and gathering more information on specific websites that could help with the original proposal but that got suddenly changed to correcting the proposal. 

### Goals for the following week

For the week of April 4th, we plan to take a deeper look at processing a greyscale image into a heightmap with the PNG class. 
Members have yet to volunteer for this task Work on researching OpenGL to see if it a viable option for graphing output (David will be working on this).
