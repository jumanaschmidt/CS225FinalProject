### Comments

Very exciting project direction! However, although the professors also find the project interesting, the selected algorithm isn't considered a graph algorithm. Please pivot the project to include graph algorithms ([examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VL05FxUCQZMLb_jQfsfOMNR56ecxy0aIaqPH6KumBQ/edit)).

A few comments on other areas:
- Where/how would you acquire the heightmap(s)?
- There should be O(nm) triangles generated. For example, we can generate 6 triangles around each pixel, totaling to O(6nm) = O(nm). 
- Timeline dates are reasonable as important dates for milestones. In reality, I'd recommend starting on tasks as soon as they are unblocked. Many of them are tricky to write and more tricky to test.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any further question or need clarification. Keep up the great work!
