# Team Contract

## Communication

**Team Meetings:** 
Our team will meet every Tuesday from 7-8 pm in person. The location will either be at Grainger, Everett, or any other building we think is convenient. In the event of sickness or weather, meetings will be held on zoom. Notes will be taken on a google doc organized by date. The notes will give a general overview of what occurred along with bullet points on highlights of the meeting. The note taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly development long entry. It must be read over by at least one other group member before submitting, preferably all members.

**Assistance:** 
Each member is in the Snapchat group chat, making it easy to reach out to the whole group for reminders and discussion. Individual members can be reached out to through individual snaps. We are committed to responding to each other within 24 hrs. 

**Respect:** 
All team members will be on equal footing. Even if team members' skills vary from beginner to advanced, all ideas and suggestions will be taken into consideration. We want to encourage everyone to speak and contribute to the meeting. Each member will be considerate and not speak over others to allow for more collaboration. For major decisions, unanimous agreement is preferred, but not required. With the signing of this document, each member will agree with the decisions made of the majority, even if they disagree.


## Collaboration

**Work distribution:**
Before the end of each meeting, the team will create the deliverables for the following week. Each member will volunteer on a task. Depending on the difficulty of the task, more than one team member can work on it in tandem. If someone doesn’t want to do it, then we will come together as a team and grind out the task in a special meeting time we choose. If that doesn’t work, then the next team meeting will be dedicated to brainstorming the task. Adjustments for workload can be reorganized through discussion on Snapchat.

**Time Commitment:**
Until the MP’s are finished, team members are expected to attend meetings(1hr) and commit at least an hour a week to the deliverable for that week. If a team is feeling cracked, they can work a max of eight hours a week. If a deliverable takes up more time than expected, other team members will be pulled in to assist. Task distribution will sometimes be done in pairs. Each pair is responsible for organizing their tasks and working on them. Weekly deliverables will be made and set during weekly meetings. 
After the end of the MP’s, team members will be expected to work 2 hours more than before.
Honesty is first and foremost, if a team member is struggling, it is expected that they reach out right away. If team members do not complete their tasks, a valid explanation will be expected. Repeated offenses will lead to staff member intervention. 

**Conflict Resolution:**
Conflicts that involve deliverables will be solved in the chat. If the conflict is big enough, an emergency meeting will be held. In the event of a task not being completed, team members will be expected to explain the situation in the weekly meeting. It is preferred that team members communicate this earlier so that others can help with the task. If members’ are habitually late, then a new time for weekly meetings will be considered, otherwise, they are expected to catch up on weekly notes and reach out to Snapchat for more information.
